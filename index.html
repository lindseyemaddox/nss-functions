  <h1>Functions</h1>

  <p>Functions are reusable code. When the same lines of code need to be repeated, put those lines of code in a function. A <strong>pure function</strong> is one that is consistent and has no effect on anything else in your system. <strong>Impure functions</strong> produce different results upon execution or affect other parts of the system when executed.</p>
  
  <h2>ChickenMonkey</h2>

  <p>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of five print chicken instead of the number. For the multiples of seven print monkey. For numbers which are multiples of both five and seven print chickenmonkey.</p>

  <h2>Take a Number - Battle of the Bands</h2>

  <p>Write a function that accepts any band name as an argument. The function will increment a global variable by one each time it is invoked, and return that number, and the band name concatenated together.</p>
